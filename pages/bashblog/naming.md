bashblog is a static blog generator, link list and knowledge base.
It solves a simple problem: It collects interesting links, thoughts and videos from various sources. It uses email and the local terminal for input to make it as universal as possible. 

*Share by Mail* is available in every app and tool. E-mail is lightweight and works everywhere, even in the subway.
By storing whole sentences it becomes searchable and even indexable by Google.

bashblog started as a simple script, but by publishing it to GitHub, it thought me much more than scripting.
