bashblog is a static blog generator, link list and knowledge base. It solves a simple problem: How to preserve the thought or a summary of an article or video. 

Bashblog receives links and videos via email and stores a text connected to it. This way an article and the gained knowledge keeps its value.

*Share via mail* is available on every platform, in every app and tool. E-mail is lightweight and works everywhere, even in the subway. By storing whole sentences it becomes searchable and even indexable by Google.

bashblog started as a simple script, but by [publishing it to GitHub](https://github.com/6uhrmittag/bashblog), it thought me much more than scripting.
