# Document, Don't Create

Documenting the process while creating something is important, but often neglected. This is the attempt of documenting learning's
and thought processes during my journey of becoming a IT wizard.

While following tutorials and how-to's I often noticed a very limited scope - installing a 
tool on a clean Ubuntu is only the very first step. In software development it's even worse - writing a tool is simple. Maintaining it, 
supporting it and adding features is almost the more important part of the story.

During my apprenticeship I'm experiencing both sides of the story. Development of very complex software, deploying it, keeping it's infrastructure up to date *and* alive.

** Developing my own tools and exploring the whole workflow myself helps me to understand the whole story. **

See the sidebar for some stories.

bashblog (2017)
:   a static blog generator in bash. first 'complex' project, pretty crude but fully functional.

[admindojo.org](https://admindojo.org) (2017)
:   attemt to develop a in-terminal-tutorial to learn linux-tasks. Written in bash which is the reason it's on hold.
    Works, with nice website, but it's just not the right language for a complex project.
    
taskbutler (2018)
:   first 'real world' project in Python. Addon for the todo-app [todoist](https://todoist.com). Started as a simple python script.
    Evolved in my *go to* project to try real-world tasks and tools. Currently includes Unittests, CI, pypi(experimental), three 3rd-party APIs and even earned a Github-starring by the Todoist founder.
